# DB-SchoolSystem
Fully hard coded (buttons, interface, events...) system, using only my knowledge with java. It is a Data Base for any school that takes in consideration everything, involving teachers, IDs, grades...

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/GradeBook.git` and have `Java` installed and initialized. You can run the file then by running the main class using an IDE.
